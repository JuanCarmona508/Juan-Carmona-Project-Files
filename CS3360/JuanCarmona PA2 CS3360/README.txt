Assuming you are in the correct directory.
pa2.cpp can be compiled using "g++ pa2.cpp -o pa2" or "g++ pa2.cpp", which allows p1.cpp to then be run using "./pa2" or "./a.out" respectively.
However pa2.cpp needs two variables in order to run properly which will be the arrival rate/lambda and the service time which is 0.04.
Thus the command will look like this "./pa2 "lambda" 0.04" "lambda" being a float representing arrival rate.
